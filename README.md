# CodingChallenge

Please, download the repository and get familiar with it.

Task is to create(refactor current) clean and readable code that shows the list of figures and the color of them. List
should refresh after pull down. (You don't have to focus on making it look great)

You can think about the solution and what to do, but please wait with the coding for the interview.

Make this code as good as possible having the limited time, some of the libraries that you may like to use, are already
added to the project, feel free to add any other that you think you may need.
