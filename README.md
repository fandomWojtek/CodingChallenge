# CodingChallenge

Please, download the repository and get familiar with it.

Task is to create clean and readable code that shows the list of figures and the color of them. List should refresh 
after pull down.

Make this code as good as possible having the limited time, some of the libraries that you may like to use, are already
added to the project, feel free to add any other that you think you may need.
